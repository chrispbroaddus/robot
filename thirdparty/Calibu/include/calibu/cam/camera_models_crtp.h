 * NOTES ON RADIAL DISTORTION MODELS (Poly2, Poly3, Rational3, etc.)
 * Generalized radial distortion model:
 *   x_d = f(r_u)*x_u                           (1)
 *   y_d = f(r_u)*y_u
 *   r_d = sqrt(x_d^2 + y_d^2)
 *   r_d = sqrt((f(r_u)*x_u)^2 + (f(r_u)*y_u)^2)
 *   r_d = sqrt((f(r_u))^2*(x_u^2*y_u^2))       (2)
 * Recall that r_u = x_u^2*y_u^2                (3)
 * So, if we want to consider purely the radii, substitute (3) into (2):
 *   r_d = r_u*f(r_u)                           (4)
 * here, r_d is known, so if we find minimum of (r_u*f(r_u)-r_d)^2 we are effectively finding
 * the zeroes of equation (4), and several models use the Newton method to approximate these quickly.
 * Using the found r_u, we use r_u / r_d = 1 / f(r_u) to compute the factor,
 * so we can compute x_u = (r_u / r_d) * x_d.
