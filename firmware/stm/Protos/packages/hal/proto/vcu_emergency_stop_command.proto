/// Request an emergency stop.

/// There are several implications of issuing an emergency stop:
/// -# Mercury will kick in and attempt to shut everything down in an orderly fashion. Specifically,
///    if were launched by mercury and sent an e-stop command, you will eventually be (forcibly, if
///    necessary) killed.
/// -# Emergency stops are always considered "safe" and hence are guaranteed to be accepted by the VCU.
///    As a result, you may have been killed prior to receiving a response to the e-stop.
/// -# The VCU will have to clear the e-stop somehow and return to idle before Mercury will attempt to
///    restart software components.
/// .
///
/// TL;DR: don't use this.
